# ELEC Honours Thesis Work
This is a repo for my electrical engineering honours thesis at UNSW.
The subject matter is graph signal processing.

## Todo
- Look at Moodle how-to guide
- Look at Moodle scoring sheet
- Review IEEE Signal Processing Magazine articles (optionally)
- Find graph temperature data sets for east coast Australia (or US or elsewhere if needed)

### Long run investigation ideas
- Stochastic signals on graphs
- Methods for constructing sparse graphs that give good results (dimensionality reduction)

### Tips
- Work on two things at once

### Data modifications
- Acorn data station 048027 min has some -999degC entries which are clearly invalid. These have been removed.
- Removed data files from stations without latitutde and longtitude data in the metadata set
